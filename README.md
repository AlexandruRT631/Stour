# Stour
This is a repository containing my project for the Software Design laboratory from my university curriculum. The aim of this project is to develop a web application, making the database, the backend, and the frontend from scrach. I decided to make a video game online store, like Steam, where users can buy games, "play" them, and make friends. There is also a special type of "user", the publisher, which can make games. 
A greater documentation of this project can be found in the ```Stour.docs``` file.

## Database
The database is written in MySQL, and this repository contains a file ```database.sql``` which is a SQL Script containing the database used for testing.

## Backend
The backend is written in Java using the Spring Framework, and it follows the layered architecture pattern. It can be found in the backend folder.

## Frontend
